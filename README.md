# What do we want to do here ?
1. A Basic NFT Contract

2. A Random IPFS NFT Contract : Create an NFT with off-chain Data (IPFS)
    It's less expensive but it is dependent on the protocol/company storing the data
    - Pros: Cheap
    - Cons: Someone needs to pin our data

3. A Dynamic SVG NFT Contract : We do kind of the same but this time on-chain
    It's way more expensive, but we can use our nft to interact with other because all the datas are on-chain and so can interact between each other
    - Pros: The data is on chain !!
    - Cons: MUCH more expensive !
